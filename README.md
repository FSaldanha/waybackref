### About

Citation of electronic documents is a valuable resource for scientific production. However, content published in internet can be changed or go offline. The [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) service, provided by [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), helps to solve that problem by saving web pages and making them available for public access.

**Wayback References** gets URLs used in user references list and checks whether they were archived by Wayback Machine, replacing them with a link to snapshot. As the service periodically saves pages, the app also gets the access date from each reference and looks for the archived snapshot with the closest timestamp to that date.

For references using [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), URL is not changed because DOI system makes sure the link will always direct to the right document.
